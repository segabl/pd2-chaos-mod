# Chaos Mod

Ever wished your heists were more chaotic and/or painful? Then this is the mod for you!
While having Chaos Mod active, random modifiers will activate during gameplay which can range from being a slight inconvenience to completely game-changing.
With over 100 different modifiers you are sure to have plenty of exciting combinations and interesting moments.

**NOTE:** This mod locks your matchmaking and you will only be able to play with other people that are also using it. All modifiers will be synced to and affect other players in your lobby.
